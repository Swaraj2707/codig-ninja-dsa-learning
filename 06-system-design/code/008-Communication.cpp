/**
 *  Assignment
 *  -   Guess if it is an example of synchronous or asynchronous communication :
 *      
 *  Part A
 *  -   When using online shopping platforms, when a user selects a product, the system 
 *      generates a query to check if the product is available in inventory or not.
 *  Ans:    synchronous
 *  -   Synchronous as the application waits for this response before allowing the user 
 *      to add the product into the cart.
 *  
 *  Part B
 *  -   When the payment process is going on for the products.
 *  Ans:    synchronous 
 *  -   Synchronous as the application waits till the confirmation of payment has been 
 *      successfully received from the bank.
 * 
 *  Part C
 *  -   After the order has been placed, a confirmation notification is sent on the phone.
 *  Ans:    asynchronous
 *  -   Asynchronous, as it can take some time for the notification to arrive, but in the 
 *      meantime a user can do anything on the application without waiting for the 
 *      notification.
