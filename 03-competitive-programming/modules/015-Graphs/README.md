# Graphs

 *  A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. 
 *  The nodes are sometimes also referred as **vertices** and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
 *  Tree is special kind of graph where nodes have a way to reach any other node only and trees doesn't have cycles.
 >  Example: 
 >  -   Social network (how person(as node) is connected to other people).
 >  -   Map for any country where cities are connected via roads.
