# Advance Recursion

>   ```Recursion``` in computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances	of the same problem. By same nature it actually means that the approach that we use to solve the original problem can be used to solve smaller problems as well.

### How does Recursion Works?
-   We can define the steps of recursion solution as follows:
    1.  ```Base Case``` : terminating condition at which function call will stop.
    2.  ```Recursive Call``` : the recursive function invoke itself for smaller problem.
    3.  ```Small Calculation``` : we perform some calculation step in each recursive call. We can perform this step before or after the **recursive call**.
