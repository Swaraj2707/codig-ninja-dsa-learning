 *      the remaining work is
 *      a)  3   b) 5    c) 10   d) 12
 *  Ans:    3
 *      -   Let the total work be LCM of 12 & 15= 180.
 *      -   Efficiency of A= 180/12= 15
 *          Efficiency of B= 180/15=12
 *          Total work done by A & B in first five days= (15+ 12)*5= 135.

 *  Ans:    120
 *      -   (A+B)’s 1 day work=(1/20),
 *      -   A’s 1 day work=(1/24) 
 *          so B’s 1 day work= (1/20)-(1/24)=(1/120).
