/**
 *  Divide Among Workers

 *      a) 24   b) 48   c) 192  d) 96
 *  Ans:    96
 *      -   8 times A’s share = 12 times B’s share = 6 times C’s share
 *      -   8a= 12b= 6c (where a, b and c are shares of A,B and C)
 *      -   Note that this is not the same as the ratio of their wages being 
 *          8:12:6. In this case, find out the L.C.M of 8, 12 and 6 and divide 
 *          the L.C.M by each of the above numbers to get the ratio of their 
 *          respective shares.
 *      -   The L.C.M of 8, 12 and 6 is 24.
 *      -   Therefore, the ratio A:B:C:: (24/8): (24/12) : (24/6):: 3:2:4;
 *      -   The sum of the total wages=3x+2x+4x=432 => 9x=432 or x=48.
