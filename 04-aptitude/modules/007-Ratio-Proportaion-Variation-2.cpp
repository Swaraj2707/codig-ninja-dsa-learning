 *  Coins Of Denominations
 *  -   A boy has a few coins of denominations 50 paise, 25 paise and 10 paise 
 *      in the such a way that 6 times the number of 50 paise coins is equal to 
 *      three times of 25 paise coins and two times of 10 paise coins. If the 
 *      total amount of the coins is Rs. 6.50, the number of 10 paise coins is
 *      a) 5    b) 10   c) 15   d) 20
 *  Ans:    15
 *      -   According to the question: 6 times the number of 50 paise coins is 
 *          equal to three times of 25 paise coins and two times of 10 paise 
 *          coins.
 *      -   50 paise coins : 25 paise coins: 10 paise coins= 1/6 : 1/3 : 
 *          ½= 1: 2: 3
 *      -   Let the numbers of 50 paise, 25 paise and 10 paise are x, 2x and 3x.
 *              50x+25×2x+10×3x=650 
 *              130x=650 
 *              x=5 
 *              2x=10,
 *              3x=15 
 *          Number of 10 paise= 15. Hence, option (c) is correct.

 *              a: b: c: d= 1: 2: 3; 4
 *      -   Hence, the runs scored by A and C= 100×((1+3)/(1+2+3+4))=40.
