 *  -   What is true for NoSQL database ?
 *  Options
 *      a.  NoSQL cannot store structured data
 *      b.  NoSQL is a database that is built on ways and means to store data in format 
 *          other than tables.
 *      c.  NoSQL uses tables to store data and is an enhanced form of RDBMS.
 *      d.  None
 *  Ans:    b
 *  -   NoSQL is a schema-free database. The data structure is used for storing is 
 *      different from what we learned in relational databases. Data structures used here 
 *      are more flexible than the relation used in relational databases. Also,  the data 
 *      is not stored in a table format. In NoSQL, data is stored in document databases, 
 *      key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

 *      c.  Relational databases
 *      d.  Distributed databases
 *  Ans:    d
 *  -   NoSQL Databases are referred to as distributed databases. It's a mechanism for 
 *      storing and retrieving data and is also claimed as the next-generation database. 
 *      They are used in real-time web applications and big data and their usage is peaking 
 *      over time. NoSQL databases go against the conventional attitude of storing 
 *      information at a single location, instead, it distributes and stores information 
 *      over a set of multiple servers.

/** 
 *  MCQ - 7 
 *  -   What are the advantages of NoSQL?
 *  Options
 *      a.  It supports semi-structured data and volatile data.
 *      b.  Read/Write throughput is very high.
 *      c.  Flexible Schema
 *      d.  Can scale up to great extent
 *      e.  All of the above    
 *      f.  None    
 *  Ans:    e
 *  -   Advantages of No SQL are
 *      1. Horizontal Scaling: Scaling out means distributing the database throughout 
 *      multiple computers when the load increases. Therefore, it can handle more traffic 
 *      simply by adding more servers to the database. It can scale up to great extent.
 *      2. High Availability: NoSQL databases are highly available due to their auto 
 *      replication feature i.e. whenever any kind of failure happens data replicates 
 *      itself to the preceding consistent state. It is available for all types of data 
 *      including semi-structured and volatile data.
 *      3.Less management:  NoSQL databases require minimum to zero management, they are 
 *      equipped to auto-repair data distribution and due to it having flexible data models 
 *      that result in reducing administration and performance difficulties. This results 
 *      in very high throughput in read/write operations
 *      4.Flexible Schema: Relational databases are used to have a defined schema, which 
 *      is quite an issue because in case you need to make any modification or addition to 
 *      the database we need to change the schema as well every time.

 *      c.  Recommendation engine
 *      d.  Network and IT operations
 *  Ans:    a, b, c, d
 *  -   The graph-based representation will help understand all these situations better 
 *      because it will help define the relationship (if any). Like for network and IT 
 *      operations, how are employees connected. Professionals these days actively use 
 *      Linkedin to connect.
 *  -   For the Recommendation Engine, it will depend upon the searches/purchases we have 
 *      made, a relationship will be established between them and hence recommendations 
 *      will be made.
 *  -   For the medical history of a person, there could be cases where certain diseases 
 *      make a person prone to other diseases as well. So that relationship could be 
 *      established. It could also be used to explain a condition if anything is being 
 *      inherited in the genes. 
 *  -   For Fraud detection, it works if any odd amount of money is being withdrawn from 
 *      the account. Now to get that judgement of odd, the database contains previous all 
 *      the transactions made, along with the time they were made.
 *  -   These form a relationship in-between them and if something is observed out of 
 *      trend/rules of relationship, fraud is detected.
 *  -   Any other database will make this process of forming relationships very tedious, 
 *      hence graph-based databases are used which are quite simple to comprehend when 
 *      talking about relationships among entities.
